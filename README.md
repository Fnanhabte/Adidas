A leader in athletic sportswear, shoes, and fashion, Adidas is disrupting manufacturing and retail with bespoke design and a digital approach that puts consumers at the center of everything the company does. <code>The Adidas website is a key part of a platform through which the brand can offer premium, connected, and personalized experiences.</code> Joseph Godsey, SVP of Digital Brand Commerce, said “We ensure that our work in digital is aligned with our core belief: Through sports, we have the power to change lives. We realized that digital is the best way to enable this through the relationship we can create with consumers. <code>The company’s most important store is no longer a physical store: It is the dot-com sites </code>, and Salesforce is an important partner for delivering the company’s digital transformation.

The digital-first strategy that Adidas has been pursuing is now paying dividends with record-breaking growth at a time when the retail industry is struggling. In 2016, the company’s overall sneaker sales grew substantially. Around that time, the company announced 24% currency-neutral growth in North America for its brands, and reported a 59% increase in ecommerce globally, which equated to approximately $1 billion in online sales.
